title: About me
---

I am interested how people develop their knowledge and skill over the lifetime. My research focuses on the investigation of how we __learn and develop expertise__, when do we reach the peak level of performance, and how we experience age-related decline in performance. As well as factors that relate to cognitive decline in the case of age-related diseases, such as __dementias__. I use large and passively collected data: chess, NBA, and football records in expertise research and electronic health records (EHRs) in clinical research.

As I am unlikely to do timely updates, you can check my publications on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=AvB8gq0AAAAJ&hl=en) or using my [ORCID ID:0000-0002-8094-0902](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8094-0902)

For most of the publications, I share my data and R code using [OSF pages](	osf.io/hvgb6)

I am also a chair of Natural Language Processing Special Interest Group run by [the Deep Dementia Phenotyping (DEMON) Network](https://demondementia.com/about/)
